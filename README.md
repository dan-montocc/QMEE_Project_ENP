__Project Title:__ _The effects of abiotic and biotic factors on periphyton and fish communities in Everglades National Park, Florida, USA_

__Datasets:__ 'ENP_FishData_1996to2000.csv'; 'ENP_FishData_2000to2005.csv'; 'ENP_FPOData.csv'; 'ENP_HabitatData.csv'; 'ENP_Temp_Sal_DO_Data.csv'; 'ENP_pH_TP_OM_Data.csv'

__Data Source:__ Florida Coastal Everglades Long Term Ecological Research Network Data Repository

__Metadata File:__ 'METADATA.md'

__Data Description:__ Data ranges from the years of 1996 to 2008 for various abiotic and biotic variables collected in Shark River Slough, Everglades National Park (ENP) in the southern tip of Florida's coast. Specifically, we have chosen data that contains species presence/absence for fish, plants, amphibians, and macroinvertebrates, as well as their abundance, and biomass where applicable. Habitat data consists of plant cover, plant height, and periphyton cover. Environmental variables consist of water temperature, water depth, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in sediment and water. Further details can be found in the metadata file, 'METADATA.md'.

__Biological Questions:__ We have predominately three areas of interest in which we would like to evaluate the effect of abiotic conditions on fish and/or plant species and diversity. Firstly, we would like to explore what impact water temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) has on fish biomass, and fish diversity, both as a net impact and/or species specific impact? Secondly, we would like to determine whether average periphyton cover impacts plant diversity and/or density? Additionally, whether plant coverage, TP in sedmient, and DO impacts average periphyton coverage? Thirdly, does periphyton coverage impact fish biomass, and/or composition of fish functional groups (i.e.: benthivore, predator, piscivore, herbivore, etc...)?

__Hypotheses:__

_Temperature and DO effects on fish_

With regards to water temperature and DO, we predict that as water temperatures increase, and DO decreases, fish net biomass should decrease, as well as the overall fish diversity should decrease. This is because, higher temperatures and lower DO tends to decrease the carrying capacity of an aquatic environment to support a larger fish community. In terms of diversity, overall fish species diversity should decrease with increasing temperatures and decreased DO, as more sensitive species would no longer be able to inhabit the area, and only hypoxic-resistant species would remain (Farwell et al., 2006).

_Plant coverage, TP, and DO impact on periphyton_

Periphyton is a critical food resource for many fish species, particularly herbivorous and omnivorous species. Periphyton coverage has been found to be linked to nutrient loading (particularly TP) and other water quality parameters, such as DO (Kannavillil and Kurissery, 2013). Periphyton also requires a hard substrate to attach to and grow, such as rocks, logs, and aquatic plants. We predict that as plant coverage/density increases, periphyton coverage should also increase. With regards to water quality parameters, we predict that as TP increases, and as DO decreases, periphyton coverage should increase.

_Periphyton coverage and its impact on fish_

Since many fish species eat periphyton, we predict that as periphyton coverage increases, so too should net fish biomass (van Dam et al., 2002). This is because we predict that increasing amounts of periphyton provides more food, particularly for species that are herbivorous and omnivorous in nature. Therefore, changes in periphyton coverage is predicted to have a stronger effect on these groups of fish species, more so than piscivore or apex carnivore species. We do however predict some effect of periphyton coverage on piscivore and carnivore fish species, due to a bottom-up effect through the food web.

__Proposed Statistics:__
We likely will be testing these hypotheses by using methods such as linear regressions (or generalized linear regression models) and/or ANOVA analyses.
